# Link Cleaner

Note: This is a fork of the original Link Cleaner project that removes all telemetry, analytics, and tracking from the app.

[Link Cleaner](https://linkcleaner.app) is a web app that removes tracking code, search parameters, and other data from URL links. The cleaned links can be copied to the clipboard, viewed as a QR code, send to installed applications using the Web Share API, or shared directly to social media platforms. Link Cleaner can also receive links through the your device's share menu as an installed web application.

Link Cleaner uses code from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [EasyQRCodeJS](https://github.com/ushelp/EasyQRCodeJS). The logo is ["Link 45deg" from Boostrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/link-45deg/).
